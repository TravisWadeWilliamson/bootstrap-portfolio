            <p>What are we if nothing but the sum of our experiences? I am always willing to try the new, be uncomfortable, take a chance. My experiences range from working on a sport fishing boat in Alaska to owning a private tutoring business in South Korea. </p>
            <p>Attending the Uniersity of Orgeon and not knowing what to study, I thought business administration was proabably a reasonable field. I majored in Finance, but in my third year, my artistic itch had to be scratched. I took 2 quarters of art </p>

            <p>classes to re-evaluate my current path. It was fun, but ultimately decided that a business degree would serve me better than one in art - the jury is still out on that one.After gratduating from the University of Oregon in '94', I immediately eschewed the idea of a "real" job and landed a contract bartending on a cruiseship. Always looking for the next challenge, I then moved on to restaurant managment and then to merchant processing.</p>
            <p>One of the most pivotal moments in my life had its genesis via an advertisement to teach ESL in South Korea. I interviewed and three weeks later I landed at Gimpo Int'l Airport. I spent the next twenty-one years building a successful life and small education business. During that time the path from ESL instuctor, to acdademic director, to starting my own business was fairly organic.</p> 
            <p>For the last 2 years I had been considereing making a change. I decided that this point in my life would be as good as any to try something completely new; to reinvent myself, so we loaded up the truck and we moved to... The USA.</p>
            <p>Planning to do things I just didn't have time to do while running a business, the first step in this life evolution life has taken me down a road nevertravelled by me before; coding! Where it takes me, no body knows. So far this life transistion has been exciting and very uncomfortable; just what it should be if I am to grow from it, right?</p>
